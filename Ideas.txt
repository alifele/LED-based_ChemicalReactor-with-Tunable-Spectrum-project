Options for the Reactor:

Prepheral :

	1. USB connection with computer so that you can change the spectrum using the GUI (maybe with LABView)
	2. Ethernet connetction (with LAN of WIFI) with internet so that one can both control the spectrum and save plot the acquied data
	to proved the 'Temperature' ,'CO2' and the spectrum
	3. GLCD ---> designers + sharif logo + Lab name
	4. Sound effects ---> welcome music + status + ...
	5. Temperature + CO2 sensor
	6. In the GUI the user can slide the slide bars to have a custom distribution (compared to a real spectrum of the sun in dashed lines)

Electronic setup:
	1. using the MOSFET with gate driver
	2.
